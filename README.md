## **Overview**
The hotel booking sector is highly customer-oriented and represents a lucrative market with significant profit potential. This dataset provides insights into booking information for two types of hotels: City Hotel and Resort Hotel. The dataset includes details such as booking dates, length of stay, number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the availability of parking spaces, among other variables.

### **Hotel Types**

**City Hotel:** Preferred by guests for short stays and business trips.

**Resort Hotel:** Chosen by guests looking to enjoy holidays or special events.

## **Data Analysis Workflow**

**Library Import:** We start by importing necessary libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc., to handle data processing and visualization.

**Data Import and Observation:**
1. Load the CSV file containing booking information.
   
2. Set data into a table format for easier observation and manipulation.

3. Analyze total bookings across hotels, and identify the top and bottom-performing hotels.

### **Customer and Hotel Analysis:**
1. Assess types of customers and evaluate the hospitality of the hotels.

2. Identify specific customer demographics, including foreign visitors who travel to these hotels.
### **Data Cleaning:**

1. Understand the dataset and its variables.

2. Handle missing values and outliers to ensure data accuracy and avoid errors.
### **Data Analysis:**
1. Analyze metrics such as the maximum number of guests and parking space availability.
   
2. Use charts to visualize data trends and patterns.
   
### **Business Insights:**
Provide recommendations for improving hotel operations and customer satisfaction based on the analysis.

## **Conclusions:**
**1. Present solutions and business objectives** derived from the data to help clients enhance their business performance.

**2. Revenue Trends:** Hotel revenue peaks in the middle of the year, likely due to local events or seasonal factors.

**3. Business Growth:** The hotel industry shows consistent annual growth, with increasing profits and breaking previous records.

**4. Booking Policies:** Many hotels have a "no deposit or no refund" policy, which may frustrate guests. Implementing additional policies could improve guest satisfaction.

**5. Lead Time:** Guests booking weeknight stays tend to have a longer lead time compared to weekend stays.

**6. Guest Retention:** Low rebooking rates suggest a need for hotels to attract more guests through themed programs and local advertisements.

**7. Average Daily Rate (ADR):** ADR varies with hotel events, showing peaks in July, December, and May, indicating that ADR is influenced by specific hotel activities rather than lead time.
